# Poisoning Attacks to Local Differential Privacy for Ranking Estimation

This repository implements poisoning attacks on ranking estimation based on the **GRR**, **OUE**, and **OLH** protocols. These protocols serve as the foundation for the repository, which focuses on executing poisoning attacks in ranking estimation tasks to evaluate the robustness of systems in the face of malicious behaviors.

## Acknowledgements

In the code for these poisoning attacks, the implementations of the three foundational protocols, **GRR**, **OUE**, and **OLH**, are based on the Multi-Freq-LDPy package. Special thanks to the authors of the package for their contributions to differential privacy techniques.
